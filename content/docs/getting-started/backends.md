If you try refreshing the page on the demo we have built so far, you can see that the `data` populates with the form's initial values, not persisting your changes. A Backend can track and save data changes, making sure all of your hard work is saved.

## Loading Content from an external API

For this example, we will use a [fake API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to fetch content and post changes. We will use the `loadInitialValues` function to fetch content.

**src/App.js**

```diff
//..

-const pageData = {
- title: 'Tina is not a CMS',
- body: 'It is a toolkit for creating a custom CMS.',
-}

function PageContent() {
  const formConfig = {
    id: 'tina-tutorial-index',
    label: 'Edit Page',
    fields: [
      //...
    ],
-   initialValues: pageData,
+   loadInitialValues() {
+     return fetch(
+       'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1'
+     ).then((response) => response.json());
+   },
    onSubmit: async () => {
      window.alert('Saved!');
    },
  }

  //...
}

//...
```

Notice how we removed `initialValues` in favor of `loadInitialValues`, which fetches data asynchronously on form creation.

> You can use `initialValues` when your data has already been fetched or defined before your components mount. Typically you would use this if you prefer to fetch your initial data server-side, as we do in our [Next.js + GitHub example](https://tinacms.org/guides/nextjs/github/initial-setup)

## Saving Content

Next we'll adjust the `onSubmit` function. When the editor clicks the 'Save' button in the sidebar, `onSubmit` will be called, sending the updated data back to the API:

**src/App.js**

```diff
function PageContent() {
  const formConfig = {
    id: 'tina-tutorial-index',
    label: 'Edit Page',
    fields: [
      //...
    ],
    loadInitialValues() {
      return fetch(
        'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1'
      ).then(response => response.json())
    },
-   onSubmit: async () => {
-     window.alert('Saved!');
-   },
+   onSubmit(formData) {
+    return fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', {
+       method: 'PUT',
+       body: JSON.stringify({
+         id: 1,
+         title: formData.title,
+         body: formData.body,
+         userId: 1,
+       }),
+       headers: {
+         'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
+       },
+     })
+       .then(response => response.json())
+       .then(data => console.log(data))
+       .catch(e => console.error(e))
+   },
  }

  //...
}
```

Note that this `onSubmit` function won't actually save those new values on the server â€” it is a fake API after all. But the response will act as if it did. This example just puts the response in the console to show what was returned.

## Adding Alerts ðŸš¨

Now, we have a form that can retrieve and save content ðŸŽ‰

However, if an editor wanted to double check if their edits were saved, they would need to check the console to see that there was an error.

[**CMS Alerts**](/docs/ui/alerts) are useful for displaying quick, short feedback to the editor. Let's add a few to improve the feedback for saving content.

### The Steps

1. Access the CMS object through the `useCMS` hook.
2. Use the `info`,`success`, & `error` methods to trigger alerts with a custom messages.

**src/App.js**

```diff
//...

function PageContent() {
+ const cms = useCMS();
  const formConfig = {
    id: 'tina-tutorial-index',
    label: 'Edit Page',
    fields: [
      //...
    ],
    loadInitialValues() {
      //...
    },
    onSubmit(formData) {
+     cms.alerts.info('Saving Content...')
      fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', {
        //...
      })
        .then((response) => response.json())
-       .then(json => console.log(json))
+       .then((data) => {
+         cms.alerts.success('Saved Content!');
+         console.log(data);
+       })
-       .catch(e => console.error(e))
+       .catch((e) => {
+         cms.alerts.error('Error Saving Content');
+         console.error(e);
+       });
    },
  };

  //...
}

//...
```

## Other backends

Tina backend agnostic, meaning you can choose the data source where Tina stores and receives data to edit. We currently have guides to implement Git Filesystem, Github, and Strapi backends, but Tina is designed to potentially work with any data source.

ðŸ‘‰ Follow theÂ [**Using Tina with Git-based Filesystem **](https://tinacms.org/guides/nextjs/git/getting-started)tutorial 

ðŸ‘‰ Follow theÂ [**Using Tina with Github **](https://tinacms.org/guides/nextjs/github/initial-setup)tutorial 

ðŸ‘‰ Follow theÂ [**Using Tina with Strapi **](https://tinacms.org/guides/nextjs/tina-with-strapi/overview)tutorial 

_We plan on adding more guides supporting different backends in the future._

## Final Notes

Tina is a toolkit to build your own custom CMS. Itâ€™s not a one-size-fits-all approach like a conventional CMS. We think the main aspects to consider when building a CMS are: constructing the editing interface, storing and managing data, and then integrating with various frameworks.

Weâ€™d like to provide developers with control and flexibility in all these aspects related to building a custom CMS. Right now, weâ€™re building Tina from the ground up, trying to make a solid foundation with React and Git-oriented workflows, but thatâ€™s just the beginning.

**Avenues to keep learning:**

* Gain clarity with our [FAQ](_Coming soon_)
* Set up [Inline Editing](/guides/general/inline-blocks/overview), or editing content directly on the page
* Configure more complex fields, such as [Blocks](/docs/plugins/fields/blocks) or the [Markdown Wysiwyg](docs/plugins/fields/markdown)
* Create new data files with [Content Creator Plugins](/docs/plugins/content-creators)
* Add Tina to a [Next.js Site](/guides/nextjs/adding-tina/overview)
* Add Tina to a [Gatsby Site](guides/gatsby/adding-tina/project-setup)
